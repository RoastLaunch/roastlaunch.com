                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Core membership gives you access to everything: curriculum, weekly coffee education, monthly business calls, and the community forum. It's self-paced. Launch Partner adds bi-weekly small-group calls with a dedicated cohort for accountability and personalized feedback. Choose Core if you work best independently, or Launch Partner if you thrive with regular accountability and peer support.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes. Start with Core and upgrade to Launch Partner whenever you want more accountability. Or start with Launch Partner and downgrade to Core if your schedule changes. You'll be charged the difference on your next billing cycle.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Launch Partner groups are limited to 6-8 people. We keep them small so you get real connection, genuine accountability, and time for your specific questions. You'll meet the same cohort every two weeks—that consistency builds trust and real relationships.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>You keep lifetime access to the curriculum modules you've already worked through. Your community forum access and live call attendance end when your membership ends. But the core education is yours forever.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>New Launch Partner cohorts begin on the 1st and 15th of each month. When you join, you'll be placed in the next starting cohort. If you want to start immediately, you can request an exception and we'll do our best to get you into a cohort with availability.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Cohorts intentionally include people at different stages—some just exploring, some actively planning, some 6 months from opening. This diversity makes the group stronger. You learn from people ahead of you and help those behind you. It's genuinely valuable for everyone.</p>
