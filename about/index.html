                    <h2>John's Story</h2>
                    <p>I spent years in a 9-to-5 job that paid well but left me spiritually empty. When I discovered specialty coffee, something shifted — not just because of the craft, but because of the community. Every great coffee shop I visited was a gathering place first. People came for the coffee and stayed for the connection. I realized that's what I wanted to build — not just a business, but a place where people belong.</p>
                    <p>But I hit a wall. I couldn't find a single resource that connected coffee craft with community building and sound business fundamentals. Everything was either too technical or too abstract. So I did what I always do — I researched obsessively, talked to dozens of shop owners, and started building the roadmap I wish had existed.</p>
                    <p>Here's where I'm radically transparent: I don't own a coffee shop yet. But I've poured that research into building something just as important — a community of people who share this calling. Roast Launch isn't just me teaching you. It's all of us building together, sharing what we learn, holding each other accountable, and proving that you don't have to do this alone.</p>

                        <p>You don't build a coffee shop alone, and you don't launch a community-centered business in isolation. Roast Launch is built around the people — weekly calls, shared learning, accountability partnerships, and genuine friendships with others who understand exactly what you're building toward.</p>

We believe your coffee shop can be both profitable and meaningful — a space where people feel welcome, where relationships deepen, and where your faith shows up in how you treat every person who walks through the door.</p>
