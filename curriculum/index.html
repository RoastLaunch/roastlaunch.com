                            <p>Most members complete the curriculum in 3-6 months depending on their schedule and how deep they dive into each module. But here's what matters: you get lifetime access. Work through it at your pace, review modules as you need them, and refer back to the curriculum even after launch.</p>

                            <p>No. Module 1 (Specialty Coffee Foundations) starts from the beginning and builds genuine expertise, even if you're new to specialty coffee.
