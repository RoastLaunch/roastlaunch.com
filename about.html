                    <h2>John's Story</h2>
                    <p>I spent years in a 9-to-5 job that paid well but left me spiritually empty. I loved specialty coffee—not as a casual hobby, but as something that awakened me to quality, craft, and purpose. I started drinking third-wave coffee, learning about single-origin beans, extraction science, and the incredible stories behind ethical sourcing. Coffee became more than caffeine; it became a way to think about creating something meaningful.</p>
                    <p>But there was a gap. I wanted to open a specialty coffee shop, but I didn't know where to start. I couldn't find a resource that bridged the gap between coffee passion and business reality. So I did what I always do—I researched obsessively. I studied the specialty coffee industry, interviewed dozens of coffee shop owners, dove deep into financial modeling, and explored how to ground this whole venture in faith, not just hustle culture.</p>
                    <p>Here's where I'm radically transparent: I don't own a coffee shop yet. But that gives me something valuable. I'm bringing rigorous research, genuine expertise in coffee and business fundamentals, and deep conviction about the importance of faith in entrepreneurship. I'm not selling you a romanticized version of coffee shop ownership. I'm building Roast Launch with people who are serious about learning the coffee, understanding the business, and building something that honors their calling.</p>
