                        <p>Every week, we come together to dive deep into specialty coffee — single-origin regions, extraction science, flavor profiling, and how to develop your palate. It's education, but it's also a shared experience with people who love coffee as much as you do.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Core gives you the full community: curriculum, weekly coffee education, monthly business calls, live Q&A, and the community forum. It's structured but self-paced — you learn and build alongside everyone. Launch Partner adds bi-weekly small-group calls with a dedicated cohort for deeper accountability. Choose Core if you work well within a larger community, or Launch Partner if you want a tight-knit group who knows your specific story.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes. Start with Core and upgrade to Launch Partner whenever you want more accountability. Or start with Launch Partner and downgrade to Core if your schedule changes. You'll be charged the difference on your next billing cycle.</p>

                            <p>Launch Partner groups are limited to 6-8 people. We keep them small so you get real connection, genuine accountability, and time for your specific questions. You'll meet the same cohort every two weeks — that consistency builds trust and real relationships.</p>

                            <p>You keep lifetime access to the curriculum modules you've already worked through. Your community forum access and live call attendance end when your membership ends. But the core education is yours forever.</p>

                            <p>New Launch Partner cohorts begin on the 1st and 15th of each month. When you join, you'll be placed in the next starting cohort. If you want to start immediately, you can request an exception and we'll do our best to get you into a cohort with availability.</p>

                            <p>Cohorts intentionally include people at different stages — some just exploring, some actively planning, some 6 months from opening. This diversity makes the group stronger. You learn from people ahead of you and help those behind you. It's valuable for everyone.</p>
